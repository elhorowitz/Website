  "I discovered the field of UX as an undergrad at Cornell University and was immediately enthralled. Here was a field that tied together all my interests - problem\/puzzle-solving, human behavior, aesthetics  - in a neat little package! I subsequently major in Information Sciences (focusing on Human Factors) and augmented my studies with academic research, working in both Cornell\u0027s Interaction Design Lab and its Reimagination Lab for two academic years and two summers.",
  "Post college, I wound up in D.C. as a business analyst at a major bank. However, even when dealing with P\u0026L forecasts all day, I found myself rearranging and color coding every model, Powerpoint deck and Excel template I used to make them more user-friendly. I fought my way into a role in Digital, where I pushed for the importance of good customer experience on the company\u0027s website. This earned me the title of Voice of Customer (VOC) expert, and I watched as customer experience, VOC in particular, become a focus for the company; my work was highlighted in executive-level presentations. I was often frustrated, however, by the distance between my work and our customers, and soon knew it was time for me to move on.",
  "In February of this year, I was accepted into the UX Apprenticeship Program at Fresh Tilled Soil, a tech design firm in the Boston area. With literally two-weeks notice, I said my goodbyes, packed up my things, and shipped up to Boston. The experience not only refreshed and developed my skills in the field, but it also deepened my conviction that UX is my occupational soulmate. I know it\u0027s cliche, it felt really, really good to be passionate about the work I was doing.",
  "I just bought a one-way ticket to San Francisco to start the \"Career in UX\" chapter of my life, and I couldn\u0027t be more excited for what\u0027s in store!"
